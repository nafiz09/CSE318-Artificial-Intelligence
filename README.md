# CSE318-Artificial-Intelligence

In this repository all the assignments I have submitted in artificial intelligence(CSE318) are included.

**1. n puzzle solver**

<p>The main objective of this assignment was to implement a n puzzle. The n-puzzle is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 𝑘 × 𝑘 grid with 𝑛 = 𝑘<sup>2</sup> − 1 square blocks labeled 1 through 𝑛 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square.</p>
